# Grid App System

A visual grid workspace where users can snap modular app widgets into place and create connections between them, forming a customizable dashboard of interconnected micro-applications.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Intuitive** - Drag-and-drop interactions feel natural and responsive
2. **Organized** - Clean grid structure provides visual order and predictability  
3. **Connected** - Visual links between apps create understanding of data flow

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Multiple interactive widgets with drag-and-drop functionality, persistent positioning, and visual connection system

## Essential Features

**Grid System**
- Functionality: Provides snap-to-grid positioning for app widgets
- Purpose: Creates organized, predictable layout that users can customize
- Trigger: Page loads with empty grid ready for widgets
- Progression: Grid visible → Widget dragged over → Snap zones highlight → Widget snaps to position
- Success criteria: Widgets align perfectly to grid cells, visual feedback shows valid drop zones

**App Widget Library**
- Functionality: Collection of small functional apps (calculator, notes, timer, etc.)
- Purpose: Provides useful micro-tools that can work independently or together
- Trigger: User clicks "Add Widget" or drags from widget palette
- Progression: Widget palette opens → User selects widget type → Widget appears on grid → User positions it
- Success criteria: Each widget maintains its state, functions independently, saves position

**Linking System**
- Functionality: Visual connections between widgets to share data or trigger actions
- Purpose: Allows widgets to communicate and create workflows
- Trigger: User drags from one widget's output to another's input
- Progression: Click link handle → Drag line appears → Hover over target → Connection established → Data flows
- Success criteria: Links are visually clear, data transfers correctly, connections persist

**Widget Management**
- Functionality: Add, remove, resize, and configure individual widgets
- Purpose: Users can customize their workspace layout and functionality
- Trigger: Right-click widget or use widget controls
- Progression: Right-click → Menu appears → Select action → Widget responds → Changes saved
- Success criteria: All changes persist, widgets can be easily managed

## Edge Case Handling

- **Overlapping Widgets**: Snap system prevents overlaps, shows invalid drop zones in red
- **Connection Conflicts**: Validate data types before allowing connections, show error states
- **Grid Overflow**: Scroll or zoom functionality when widgets exceed viewport
- **Invalid Links**: Prevent incompatible connections, provide clear error feedback
- **Widget Errors**: Error boundaries contain widget failures without crashing the grid

## Design Direction

The design should feel like a professional workspace tool - clean, minimal, and purposeful with subtle visual depth to distinguish the grid structure and widget layers.

## Color Selection

Analogous (adjacent colors on color wheel) - Using cool grays and blues to create a calm, professional workspace feeling that doesn't compete with widget content.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue-Gray `oklch(0.3 0.05 240)` - Communicates professionalism and focus
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Gray `oklch(0.95 0.01 240)` for grid background, Medium Gray `oklch(0.7 0.02 240)` for borders
- **Accent Color**: Bright Blue `oklch(0.6 0.15 240)` - For active connections, selection states, and interactive elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray #F8F9FA): Dark Gray text (#2D3748) - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓
  - Card (White #FFFFFF): Dark Gray text (#2D3748) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue-Gray #4A5568): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Blue #3B82F6): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 4.5:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should be clean and technical, conveying precision and functionality without being sterile - Inter for its excellent readability at small sizes common in widget interfaces.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Grid Title): Inter Bold/24px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Widget Titles): Inter Semibold/16px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Widget Labels): Inter Medium/14px/normal spacing
  - Body (Widget Content): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Grid Info): Inter Regular/12px/wide letter spacing

## Animations

Smooth, purposeful transitions that guide user understanding of the spatial relationships and provide feedback for interactions without being distracting.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the physical metaphor of moving objects in space
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: 
  - Primary: Widget drag/drop with smooth transforms
  - Secondary: Connection line drawing with elastic feel
  - Tertiary: Hover states and selection feedback

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - Card for individual widgets with subtle shadows for depth
  - Button for widget controls and grid actions
  - Dialog for widget configuration
  - Popover for connection point tooltips
  - Badge for widget status indicators
- **Customizations**: 
  - Custom DragGrid component for snap-to-grid functionality
  - Custom ConnectionLine component for visual links
  - Custom WidgetContainer with resize handles
- **States**: 
  - Widgets: idle, dragging, selected, connected, error
  - Grid cells: empty, occupied, valid-drop, invalid-drop
  - Connections: active, inactive, data-flowing, error
- **Icon Selection**: 
  - Plus for adding widgets
  - Move for drag handles
  - Link for connection points
  - Settings for widget configuration
  - X for removing widgets/connections
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px grid system, 8px padding within widgets, 4px for tight spacing
- **Mobile**: Widgets stack vertically on mobile, touch-friendly drag handles, simplified connection interface
